# WanderList
WanderList is a content platform for generating ranked order lists.  Any number of items can be entered into our platform and can be semantically tagged and shared. URLs for images can be copy and pasted into our input form.  Currently, we support URLs that end in .gif, .jpg, and .png.

##Installation
The app can be accessed at http://ec2-54-200-161-78.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/.  You may either clone this repo or fork it.

##Usage
From the root of the project directory, run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.  The app should now be accessible at localhost:3000.

Now begin discovering user-created lists! Once you have an account and are authenticated, you may save your favorite lists and upvote/downvote to express how you feel about particular lists!

As is consistent to websites with voting/liking features, clicking your own upvote/downvote will cancel your previous upvote/downvote.
